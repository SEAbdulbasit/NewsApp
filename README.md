# NewsApp

This is a news app to fetch top headlines from different sources.

If the fingerprint is detected then it will ask for authentication otherwise will skip. Also if
fingerprint
not authenticated or some error occurred the app will close.

The aim was to do the simplest implementation. There are Unit tests, plus UI tests. Overall test coverage is 100% for Non-UI layers.
There are UI tests for the Listing and Details screen.

> **Note**

1. Currently the API key is being used directly but can be obfuscated
2. Query can be improved
3. Images cache can be implemented
